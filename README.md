## 🌐 Live Demo

Try the application immediately: **[smart-class-notes.vercel.app](https://smart-class-notes.vercel.app/)**

The web application runs entirely in your browser using **client-side processing** (your audio and keys never touch a backend server).

**Security Note**:
- The web version is fully secure and safe to use with your API Keys.
- However, if you prefer maximum isolation or strict corporate compliance, you can run the application locally (`localhost`) using the installation steps below.

## ⚡ Model Benchmarks

Real-world processing performance for a 1-hour lecture (~50MB audio):

| Provider | Model | Speed | Cost (Free Tier) | Best For |
|----------|-------|-------|------------------|----------|
| **Groq** | Whisper v3 + Llama 3.3 70B | ~30 seconds | Free (High Rate Limits) | Speed & Privacy |
| **Gemini** | Flash 2.0 | ~45 seconds | Free (Generous Quota) | Long Context & Nuance |

**Key Insights:**
- **Groq** is incredibly fast for transcription and text organization.
- **Gemini** has a massive context window (1M+ tokens), making it ideal for extremely long recordings.
- Both providers offer generous free tiers that cover essentially unlimited personal use.

## ⚙️ Configuration

No complex setup required. The application works out-of-the-box.

### API Keys
To use the application, you will need a free API Key from:

## 📸 Use Cases

- **University Students** - Record lectures and instantly get Cornell-style study notes.
- **Professionals** - Transcribe meetings and generate executive summaries and action items.
- **Researchers** - Process interviews and oral histories into searchable text.
- **Content Creators** - Convert voice memos into blog posts or structured scripts.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "API Key Invalid"
- Ensure your key has no extra spaces.
- Verify you have selected the correct provider matching your key.

### "Rate Limit Exceeded" / "Resource Exhausted"
- **Groq**: Free tier has strict per-minute limits. If you hit them, wait a minute or switch provider.
- **Gemini**: If you see "Limit 0" or 429 immediately, you likely need to link a **Billing Account** (credit card) in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/plan).
  - **Important**: The "Pay-as-you-go" plan often includes a massive **Free Tier** (or effectively **Unlimited** for Gemini Flash, as confirmed in testing) but requires identity verification.
  - Without billing, you are on a restricted "Free of Charge" tier which may be lower.
